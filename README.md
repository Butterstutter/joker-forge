# Joker Forge

A web app that allows you to make Balatro Jokers using Steammodded with ease. It aims to lower the barrier to entry for mod creation, moving beyond simple stat adjustments to enable the creation of truly unique and complex Joker behaviors, all without requiring direct Lua scripting knowledge from the user. The core philosophy is abstraction and empowerment: abstracting the underlying SMODS code into intuitive visual components, thereby empowering users to translate their creative gameplay ideas into functional mods.

[Try It Out](https://jokerforge.jaydchw.com/)

It does this with a Trigger > Condition > Effect system. Most vanilla jokers follow this system. With this system, less complex jokers like Droll Joker become: When a Hand is Played (Trigger) > If Scoring Cards = Flush (Condition) > Then +10 Mult (Effect). Jokers abilities are set using the built-in Rule Builder.

**STILL EARLY IN DEV, EXPECT ISSUES, MISSING FEATURES, AND ANNOYANCES FOR NOW**

## Implementation Status Checklist

The plan here is to implement enough triggers, conditions, and effects, so as that each vanilla joker in Balatro can be replicated within Joker Forge.
